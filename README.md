# Space Race
### Multiplayer racing game powered by [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/?devrel_gh=Space-Race).

Playing a game alone is not nearly as fun as playing with your friends and that's why online games like massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) are a huge revenue stream that continues to grow rapidly every year. In June 2018 [consumers spent an estimated $9.1 billion digitally across all platforms [on MMOs]](https://www.superdataresearch.com/us-digital-games-market), compared to $7.9 billion last June. The design of online games can range from simple text-based environments to incredibly complex virtual worlds. A few other examples of popular online multiplayer games types include first-person shooters (FPS),  real-time strategy games (RTS), and multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA).
